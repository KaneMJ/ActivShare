# ActivShare
# Share Activities with Others

ActivShare was created by Matthew Kane. After researching Node.js and MongoDB I created ActivShare to practice new technology I had learned. It also incorporates a Google 0Auth 2.0 login system and styling was created using the materialize library. it is a website blog to share activities with others.
